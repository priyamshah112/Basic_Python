The code is tested on odroid xu4 and Arduino Mega serial interfacing for read and write based on LED one can extend that logic for other sensors reading and stuffs.
One can simply install package pip3 install serial in python 3.5 and communicate with LED code built on Arduino.

The Basic meaning of setup is There is Arduino code which checks for serial availability and when python writes a serial write character 't' (just an example can use any condition) the Arduino code verifies the condition and logic inisde if runs that is glow led for 10sec and then low.There are baudrate and serial port connection made which are very important.Also note that anything one writes in serial.println of Arduino can be read at ser.read() of python.
